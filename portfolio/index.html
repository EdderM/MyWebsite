					<p>
						The image on the right is of my current computer. I first built it back when I was in highschool. Some of my friends had computers themselves, but I've never thought of getting one until then. Long story short; during the summer I earned enough money and had done my research about what parts to get and built it. Computers were really interesting, which kept me going. A few upgrades were made and this is how is currently looks.

				<h3 class="mainh3"><i class="fa fa-question-circle" aria-hidden="true"></i>Why I am becoming a Programmer</h3>
					<p>
						I hear that many programmers get paid a decent amount and it is a career you can always improve in and new opportunities. With improvement comes promotions and that's why I want to be a programmer. It's a job where you can expand your knowledge in and get rewarded with it too. I like learning new things and programming seemed interesting and a promising career.

					<p>This website was created when I was in my first year of College. This is one of the four I took. It is just a start, but I'd like to get better at Web Development. It seems you need a lot of creativity to persue this. That can go with any programming language, but I'd like to improve my skills. This website is A final project of mine.</p>
