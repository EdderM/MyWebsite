		<h2>HTML Table</h2>
		<p>This table was created while I was taking a course on HTML in College. It is a list of my favorite games and why. I can't show images of the game or logos due to copyright claims.</p>
		<table>
			<tr>
			    <th>Game</th>
			    <th>Why I like it</th>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>Elden Ring</td>
			    <td>This game was released early 2022. It was very popular for good reason. It gave you lots of freedom and you could do basically anything the game allowed. It is an RPG(Role-playing Game). There was no direct story you had to follow, you could chose to do anything in the game. It also had hard bosses that challenged you. I like it becasue there is no right way to play the game, you could chose your own way to play and end the game.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
			    <td>Call Of Duty WWII</td>
			    <td>This game is not like the other COD's that have been released recently. It was most popular in 2017-18 when the game was released. I like it because there isn't much to the game like the other ones. All you really have to do is aim and shoot, which is something I got the hand of real quick.</td>
			</tr>
			<tr>
				<td>Resident Evil 7</td>
				<td>When I first discovered I was sceptical at first. Seeing the graphics gave me doubt that the game would be any good, but I got proven wrong. Both the story and the preasure of trying not to be caught was fun. I'm not a big fan of horror, but this game changed my mind. It had nice puzzles for you to try and solve and always kept you on your toes. Great story nice pacing and all in all fun game. </td>
